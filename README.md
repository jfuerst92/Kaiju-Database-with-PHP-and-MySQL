# Kaiju-Database-with-PHP-and-MySQL

This is a small, completely unpolished website that has a working database of Godzilla characters. Allows the client to Add, remove, and search for entries and relevant details

This is mostly for refamiliarizing myself with PHP and MySQL after a short time not using them
